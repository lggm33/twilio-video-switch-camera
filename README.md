# Viewing on a mobile device.
If you want to test this on a mobile device, you will need to make a tunnel to your local machine. I recommend you use ngrok for this. You can download and install ngrok from ngrok.com. Once you have it installed, run ngrok http 5000

https://ngrok.com/product

This will open a tunnel to the locally hosted project. You will get two randomly generated URLs, enter the HTTPS version into the browser in your mobile device.
